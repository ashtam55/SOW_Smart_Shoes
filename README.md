## Executive Summary
This documentation is to serve as a 'Statement of Work' or SOW for designing & developing a smart footwear to enhance and empower people in emergency situation. The advancement in the field of IoT, Networks, Computing and Data Science has made possible Integrated systems that can help businesses. Such a system would include a means to capture, catalogue and analyze data, along with tools to enforce 'business logic'.

LogicBots will work with Mr Srajit Gaur to:

* Develop edge device firmware.
* Design PCB for edge device.
* Research & Procurement of BOM. 
* Develop and Engineer the system.
* Provide documentation of the new system.
* Knowledge Transfer/Integrate with Mr Srajit Gaur.

LogicBots proposes to design, develop v1.0 of the proposed system to Mr Srajit Gaur.

The Value Proposition of using LogicBots for this project are:
* Proven engineering techniques for making Integrated systems.
* Leveraging our experience in working with IoT toolkit (ESP/ARDUINO) to bootstrap your effort. 
* Using subject matter experts to complete the project quickly. Rapid project completion minimizes disruptions and allows organizations to realize cost-saving quickly.

## Delivery Scope

* Project Definition
    - A review of the current system which helps in the firmware & design developing of the devices.
    - A project kickoff meeting to discuss and document the complete scope of this system and the goals and requirements of this project.

## Device APIs

* Admin SDK / APIs to interact with the device for setting -
    - Personel number to send SOS signal.
    - Getting Device status like battery, gprs signal etc. 
## Devices

* Data to Capture from Devices

```
WROOMÂ­32:        Main component which works as a CPU.  

GSM:            For providing GPRS and send distress signal.

GPS:            Getting lat & long for the current location.

FORCE/Pressure Senor: For detection of distress situation.
```


## Maintenance (if required)
The period after the development for maintaining the product to be discussed with Mr Srajit Gaur as it incurred extra charges.

## Exclusions
The followings are excluded from the project scope
* The packages used and maintained by LogicBots for interfacing with IoT Devices.
* Footwear/Shoe designing is not include in SOW.

## Deliverables

![sample-img](https://www.tekscan.com/sites/default/files/images/photo/shoe%20with%20sensor.jpg)
Main high level tasks are given below - 

1. Designing & Developing the device firmware which include standalone captive portal on which user can able to set number, view device details etc.

2. Designing the PCB with all the component.

4. Adding Authentication on captive. 

6. GPS functionality for accessing the device location.

7. Integration of GSM module for providing internet connectivity.

4. Software Access - top-level Git repositories for the hardware SDKs and APIs.

5. Documentation for the proposed changes in the system.

## Investment and Cost (To be discussed)
#### Phase - 1
In this phase Logicbots will be working on - 
* Researching, brainstorming and finalizing the whole system architecture from hardware to software stack.
* Develop a bare version 1 firmware of the system on breadboard to check the whole system efficiency.

* Man-hour required: 12 week ( Sensor delivery time not included )

* Hardware required & Sourcing Cost: TBD

 * Payment Schedule

| Milestone                                                      | Percentage    | Amount | 
| -------------                                                  |:-------------:| -----: |  
| Hardware Sourcing + Research                                   | 50%            | (Hardware cost) + $1000 |
| First working prototypes (with breakout board)                 | 100%           | $1500 |


#### Phase - 2
In this phase Logicbots will be working on - 
* Designing the PCB, making the device compact in size and ensure all components are working.
* Fabrication of the PCB end-to-end which includes sourcing the hardware, generate gerber files for printing the PCB and finding the right vendor for PCB manufactring.

* Man-hour required: 8 week ( Sensor delivery time not included ) with 1 device ready to ship after 2 weeks.

* Hardware required + Sourcing Cost + PCB printing charges: TBD

 * Payment Schedule

| Milestone                                                      | Percentage    | Amount | 
| -------------                                                  |:-------------:| -----: |

| First working prototypes                                       | 20%           | $1500  |
| Second working prototypes                                      | 80%           | $600   |
| Software handover + Documentation                              | 100%          | $200   |


##### Devices/Sensors/PCB printing and delivery cost to be paid as a first milestone.
##### Milestone should be funded before LogicBots start working on that particular milestone.


## Customer Responsibilities
